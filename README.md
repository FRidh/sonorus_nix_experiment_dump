# Creating auralisations with Nix

For my research I analyse aircraft recordings and try to reproduce the audible sound. 
My goal here was to use the Nix expression language and package manager for creating reproducible analyses and simulations.

In the end I discontinued this effort because it required wrapping a large part of my Python functions in Nix, and passing data along as files.
This repository contains a dump of the code. It cannot be used without the data and is likely of not much use.
